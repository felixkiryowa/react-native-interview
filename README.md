# React Native Software Engineering Interview

# Instructions

Create a React Native app that consumes the [OpenCage Geocoding API](https://opencagedata.com/api) that will allow a user to enter an
origin and destination and view these locations on a Google Map. The app should be able to automatically map a route from the origin 
to the destination. The app should also allow the user to specify a travel mode i.e. driving, bicycling, transit or walking and base 
the route map on the mode of travel.
